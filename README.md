🐍 Snake Game with Obstacles
Welcome to my very first Java project — a simple, fun Snake game built entirely using Core Java and Swing! 🎉
I created this project during my first year of B.Tech, and it helped me understand the fundamentals of GUI programming, game loops, event handling, and collision detection.

🎮 Game Features
🟢 Smooth snake movement with arrow key controls

🍎 Random apple spawns and score tracking

⛔ Obstacles (3x1 blocks) to avoid

⏱️ Live timer showing how long you've survived

🪦 Game Over screen with score and time

🔁 Retry option (press Enter to restart)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Java 8+

Swing (JFrame, JPanel, Timer, KeyListener, etc.)

No external libraries!

🎯 What I Learned
Basics of Java GUI development

How to use 2D arrays and coordinate systems

Managing game states and user input

Adding logic for collision detection and movement

🖥️ How to Run
Clone this repo

Open it in your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ or Eclipse)

Run the GamePanel.java file

Use Arrow Keys to move the snake

Press Enter to retry when game is over
